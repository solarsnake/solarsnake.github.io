## Hello World!

This is the very first post on my new terminal-themed blog, powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I'm excited to start sharing content here. Stay tuned for posts about:
* Technology and software development
* Personal projects
* Maybe some musings on sheep (as per the README!)

Feel free to explore the site using the terminal commands on the homepage!
