                <p>Hello, you ever-expanding world. I'm in need of a creative outlet, and since nothing seems to fill it, I'm going to find it here. Read, criticize, proliferate at your convenience; the filter is off.</p>
                <p>What follows is a series of <em>fictional</em> diary entries of a man who we will hopefully come to know. I want to stress, if the italics don't already do it, that this is fiction - I'm not trying to be the next crazy-anything - so don't take anything you hear or see literally.</p>
                <p class="text-sm" style="color: #00AA00;">^^ that's mainly for the relatives who already think that there's something wrong with my head ;)</p>
                <p>And that's it. I hope you enjoy, or at the very least, that it makes you think.</p>
                <p>With the words of a friend, I (the <em>real</em> me) bid you adieu;</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Why are we so cynical?</p>
                    <p>We are the disappointed consequence of static hope. We are your lack of inspiration and ambition. We are the result of an absentee culturalism. Your past has driven us mad. You call us the American Broadcast Generation.</p>
                    <p><strong>We are the Burnout Generation.</strong></p>

                <p>It takes a man to make a man, a woman to make a man, and a man to destroy the world. I'm not being sexist, it's just the experience I've had in life.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I wonder whether it's really worth it, then I fall asleep. I dread the day my dreams catch up to my reality.</p>
                <p>I would hope, if it's still possible to do so, that the whole is more essential than its pieces, but now that everyone has a voice, it's hard to hear anything anymore. The truth is no more certain than the job, or the lifestyle, or the personality.</p>
                <p>Despair is a difficult place to return from, but I'm working hard. I think no one suffers more than they're supposed to, but I can't quite figure out why. In some ways we're blessed with our uniqueness only to find that when it's all said and done, we were all just the same anyway.</p>
                <p>I hate horoscopes and astrology because they've proven their truth to me. Again, I must hope for the whole.</p>
                <p>Let's stop talking about it and DO SOMETHING already. If there's anything I know, it's that there are people who act, and people who react. In this country, the latter far outweighs the former.</p>
                <p>But I still hope for the whole.</p>

                A powerful manifesto about breaking free from the systems of control, the importance of education, and the need to stop being sheep in a world designed to herd us.

                <p>Channels of thought are subject to currents, as are all slaves of time, but what is clarity if not objective? And how can anything be objective when perception is what dominates our existence?</p>
                <p>It follows that there are no moments of clarity, no religious fervor, no awakenings; nothing removed from the simple fact of perception.</p>
                <p>These things still exist, however, and it's confusing. It leads one to conclude that if the mind makes it real, for all intensive purposes, it is.</p>
                <p>So are we to assume we're all stuck in clouds of our own misgivings and associations? That from the moment we're born it's all reception and no output?</p>
                <p>What stops the circle from continuing: language, perception, thought… is there nowhere left to turn for solution?</p>
                <p>If we're all part of the hive, then we're all just like ants; moored sheep crying out for exactly what they want us to want. We've done nothing but prove them right: that a new world order is not only inevitable but was succinct and is smarter than all of us.</p>
                <p>Clamor about all the justice you seek and hear as it reverberates into the abyss they created; watch as we're berated with language befitting a 12-year-old until the mind no longer thinks for itself.</p>
                <p>Watch as the sheep are herded, blindly stampeding along a paved path; steered into survival and acceptance, or possibly "saved" by the church.</p>
                <p>Are we to assume there's no choice in the matter? That our acquiescence is not only chosen but accepted by others as well?</p>
                <p>Stronger men than I have not sat idly by, so excuses are running thin.</p>
                <p>Do you want a figurehead? Give me a name.</p>
                <p>In this world the tides are turning, not only because the walls that safekeep information are falling, but because we are, en masse, smarter than any of you.</p>
                <p>It's a simple equation that's balancing out; there was just an unexplainably exponential advantage when the plans were being laid.</p>
                <p>Now that the gates are down, there will be onslaught.</p>
                <p>The first mistake was to make it universally accessible, but then again, when you try so hard to hide a secret, its inevitability often escapes you.</p>
                <p>The second was to invent college, which on top of the 6-8 years that came before it was an outrage. I mean really, how long do you think it takes for us to develop?</p>
                <p>Exactly. As fast as we're allowed to. Didn't come up with that answer? You've been tricked.</p>
                <p>My son will learn as soon as he's interested. As soon as the lightbulb goes off, there will be the answer, or several plus notes. There will be no disconnect between the things we think and the things we know, and it will be expected that more knowledge is always available.</p>
                <p>You cannot hide from a generation of people who think like that. There are no shadows of truth anymore. A discerning eye and a flair for detail is all the conscientious observer requires.</p>
                <p>Freedom is as ascertainable as flying a spaceship to the moon, only now our feet are planted and when we move, the whole world moves with us.</p>

                A meditation on our digital age, the loss of time for reflection, and concerns about a future where individualism might be lost to the collective digital consciousness.

                <p>We live in a time of seconds, minutes and hours. Extensions, feelings, collaboration - there is no time left for these things. We live moment to moment in a world that lasts for no more than the time it takes to refresh a browser. Advents can only pursue dreams in windows of time that would otherwise be considered absurd. Every day there is something new to talk about, new to discuss.</p>
                <p>What is this world without time or reflection? Where do we find ourselves in space that has no respect for the common human thought process? It's no wonder half the population is diagnosable with ADHD when a minute cannot pass in silence.</p>
                <p>I worry for the future my son will grow up in. I worry that there will be no time for peace because all the words and associations are thought up for us; predicted and promoted and passed along - individualism seems better suited for the past.</p>
                <p>Part of me imagines that this world will be a better one, fraught with the loss of synchronicity and dependence. Left to ourselves, the world was a lonely and isolated place, but now, no matter the distance between us, we all exist as one.</p>
                <p>Then the voice that distracts me fills my mind with thoughts of terror and manipulation. A population of sheep guided by "their peers" - a mask of interdependence that is as easily honest as it is corrupt. There is now a facsimile between us and the world - a layer of gauze that is transparent and opaque without the reference point of humanity to guide it. We make choices based on others who have made the choice before - safety is (not) guaranteed.</p>
                <p>Problem? No problem. Google problem.</p>
                <p>But who is to say anyone with all the answers is our friend? Who's to say an algorithm is better at predicting what we want than old white men in a high tower? Why does the freedom of the internet feel so constraining?</p>
                <p>I hope there will be a place for those who chose to live without it, but I can't say I know of any practical examples that result in happiness or success. Everyone seems tied to the same string.... I routinely live vicariously through people all over the world. I see them in my "feed", living their lives in moments and status updates. It is a cruel world that can present you with limitless opportunities yet confine you to one.</p>
                <p>Where does this all lead? I want to know, but I can't google it.</p>
                <p>So where do I go now?</p>

                <p>Don't pretend you don't know, that the fates have conspired to obscure you from the truth - close your eyes and open your mind. It's everything; god is not in the details, it is the vibrant life that is spread before our eyes, don't you see?</p>
                <p>The land of light gives us questions and yet we still fear in the uncertainty of the night; judging not what lies before us but instead turning inwards, where all roads lead only to destruction. Keep your harbingers to yourself and let the daemons tear you from your essence while we watch as you are rebuilt in the flames. Realize not that the world is blind but that it is blinded - the darkness is only hidden by the light.</p>
                <p>Prophecies of truth always cling to something material; an idea is as tangible as fruit from a tree. Question all that is taught to you in effervescence and trust nothing but your instinct.</p>
                <p><strong>Energy is the answer. Power is the reward for failure.</strong></p>
                <p>Built within us is a ticking time bomb that must be stopped at all costs. Imagine an army commanded to defend it - their sole goal being the salvation of all humankind. Now imagine that salvation was something they created in their heads. Something that once convinced of, you would succumb to as well, but if only for the simple fact of its sheer brilliance of manipulation.</p>
                <p>Then imagine that ticking time bomb is death. And to fight it is something we've all known since birth - that life is worth living and we want to eat every breath from it.</p>
                <p>When the time comes to face the inevitability of it all, will your convictions hold true? Will you side with what you've known or what you've been taught?</p>
                <p>That's the problem with humanity, see, because we think about every action for what it's "worth". We fight with every ounce of our body against instinct, and the reality that exists when you act upon it.</p>
                <p>There are no more questions, only answers to things you shouldn't have to ask. If it doesn't make sense then end it; if the shoe doesn't fit don't wear it. Don't let your life become a series of choices you don't understand.</p>
                <p>Act upon your reality and it will react back upon you. Release your energy and the world will be there to receive it. The only thing constraining us is this idea that because we are anxious, we are sick; that there's something wrong with us and not the world we've been forced to live in. BULLSHIT!</p>
                <p>If only words could set us free. How depressing they only affect us when we look back at them, but so it goes with permanence - the action is delayed on the promise of a recorded present, perfected to be so much more than the inexplicably immutable collaboration that was the moment, just past.</p>

                A reflection on how cinema and media have shaped personality and perception, and the realization that truth cannot be revealed through mediums of interpretation.
            </p>

            <div class="full-post-content">
                <p>As I look back on life and the actions that have led to this point of confusion, I begin to put the pieces together. The mistakes, the lost love, the trials and successes alike; there must always be a reason or, at the very least, a moment of inception.</p>
                <p>I realize now where my tastes and personality come from, born out of the desire to escape a world I refused to comprehend. We sink in isolation away from the truth in favor of the fantasy that is presented before us: the movies.</p>
                <p>I am a child of the cinema, born from the desires of great heroes and villains, taught by the lessons of change and subtext. Everything I know about people is from that silver screen, making me a master manipulator of image and perception. I learned how to hide the truth while making the search endlessly fascinating for those around me, holding my cards so tight to the chest that all were convinced of the lie.</p>
                <p><strong>Truth is clarity, which cannot be revealed through a medium. Interpretations can lead to assumptions, never more, never less.</strong></p>
                <p>Dissect me endlessly only to realize what was underneath is not where the path should have led - only in cinema can such deceit continue to enrapture its audience.</p>
                <p>There comes a time when the curtain must fall, and the bare skin is left to breath fresh air for the first time, gasping and choking at the stark and bitter taste of it all.</p>
                <p>I do not wonder why we hide, only what happens when we reach the end of our disguise. If the world is too unforgiving to handle when masked, how can it possibly be a place the unsheltered can live?</p>
                <p>I often wonder if the reason we have yet to wake up is because the inevitable shock would kill us all, reverberating into the cold world we've destroyed in pursuit of someone else's dream.</p>
                <p>There are two things to be in a world like this: a creator or consumer. The creators have the shortest fall, but will imagine the longest, while the consumer will fall for eternity and never perceive a moment of it.</p>
                <p>I am at the end of my willful ignorance. I refuse to blind or be blinded another day. If you're with me, spread the word. We can no longer live by the morals of a collective, for they will always be questioned by those with no say. Figure out for yourself what is right and wrong and refuse to be swayed by the "consensus".</p>
                <p><strong>We cannot live in a world that was created for us - we must rise and create one for ourselves.</strong></p>

                <p>Treacherous be these, the waters of our souls. Ice that breaks can only ever be so thin. Protect those you love and abandon those you fear, but to strengthen the ice is impossible - you aren't in control of this.</p>
                <p>Sink or swim, it must be better than floating, yet so many choose to remain in this limbo. If acceptance isn't the answer, it's time to try a new solution. Fear is overcome and desire is at bay, now the beast is free to pick its fancy.</p>
                <p><strong>Are you predator or prey?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Decide before you're eaten.</strong></p>
                <p>This is the secret, untaught and untamed. Left for the wilderness to guess at and grope, manipulating my secret societies and conspiracy theories. Dragged screaming into a shroud of its former self; out of the caves and into the cages.</p>
                <p>Protection is a myth, left for darker skies unseen, yet we sit around and wonder why we aren't comforted by it. Believe in one thing that is us, that is the history we have created together. The destruction and the hate; misery left untold as liars win the games they've created in recoil from the truth.</p>
                <p>Money is no object, it's a method. Family is no comfort, it's a guideline. Love is not the answer, it is the disease. It is written into the timeline of history and exploited as a loaded gun, pressuring you to the point of destruction and chaos, when connection and companionship is all a soul needs.</p>
                <p>Believe in the cycle you live, for it is too late for you to escape it. Manage the consequences of your actions and discover that presence of mind is a skill more difficult to learn than any school book.</p>

                <p>Deep inside us is a need to perceive the world. It is how we gain control and confidence from our "unique" situations. It is shaped by and defined entirely by language: Words.</p>
                <p>I see a child struggling to learn expression and how repetition is a tool, but what can we expect from the rest of life if we must repeat things to understand them? It has prescribed more meaning to the endless spirals I see around me.</p>
                <p><strong>Fear is the knowledge that the edge is only a step away at any moment, and Love is the security we feel from trusting the world around us to catch us if we fall.</strong></p>
                <p>No wonder the two have been at odds for all of time.</p>
                <p>It's this endless search for perception that we lose ourselves to; considering it something natural and decided derails the truth from ever reaching us. We believe that "control is an illusion" for god's sake. It hurts to realize that all words are part of the problem.</p>
                <p>What are we left with to search with if language is our dome: our master; our Truman Show?</p>
                <p>"Search your feelings, Lord Vader."</p>
                <p>I hate that we call them emotions. Energy is my preferred term.</p>
                <p>Meditation somehow remains below the surface of society, leading me to believe there's some unknowably strong force fighting it. But we can't blame religion for all of the world's problems.</p>
                <p>So now we're back to where we started, trying to convince ourselves out of this hole because where's the hope - salvation obviously wasn't effective enough. There has to be something unifying beyond all measure, or reach… or touch…</p>
                <p>Something we haven't seen yet, but can imagine. And if enough of us can picture it clearly enough, perhaps we can alter how we perceive and evolve.</p>
                <p>Influence the change you want to see in the world, then become it. You don't have to 'be' right away, if the goal is to all 'be' together.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Do we not suffer the same way? Is the story of our lives not but a kindred struggle to escape? Searching for unity will show you everything but and yet I still think it to be true. There is no way to count the connections made in a brain in any single day, but there is an immeasurable clarity when you connect with another human being.</p>
                <p>What is there to fight about that's external to our inner turmoil? Is the way we act not a deeper reflection of our selves? If the fight is internal, why do so many suffer because of the nature of greed?</p>
                <p>It feels to me that we're in limbo, wading through the tasks of everyday life and glimpsing, however briefly, those moments of pure energy exchange or release. Perhaps heaven is visualized best as a place where energy is constantly in balance and there are no side effects of a physical existence.</p>
                <p>I wonder what constrains us to the words of a book, or the thoughts of any one particular voice, so much more so than the thoughts we seem capable of generating collectively. It seems a battle in futility that we choose to hang on to instead of trusting the collective, like our individuality really means something to the world.</p>
                <p>I once believed there needed to be a voice that drove me, but it has dawned on me that voice is what separated me from my fellow inmates. I could never be part of something until I let go of that omnipresent vision. And then my art died, and I lost sight of what goals I had and the future that lay in front of me and I panicked, struggling ferociously to get it back.</p>
                <p>All the attachments that made me who I am I felt the need to pass down and retain, as though somehow my possessions had shaped me. I fell back into the material world as hard as I had ascended out of it and cowered there, alone again with my voice.</p>
                <p>"Fuck the world. Fuck everyone in it. Fuck that we're a young species and it's inevitable that change on a mass scale will take generations. I've seen the evil in people and known it in myself. Alone we will continue to suffer, in silence."</p>
                <p>There are very defined cycles to the ways in which we experience the world. You must choose a side, then succumb to the pitfalls of it, for an existence in both worlds will tear you apart. Compromise that benefits both sides is an amendment to a broken system.</p>
                <p>Imagination makes things so clear and simple; the single best gift and worse curse our species has ever achieved. We know what we want, yet can't bring ourselves to want it bad enough to suffer through the change.</p>
                <p><strong>Of course this is limbo. Of course this is heaven. What else did we have to stimulate our imaginations?</strong></p>

                A brief reflection on the mysterious ways life can take us, dreams as potential meeting places, and the role of fate in our choices.

                <p>The ways in which life can take you are mysterious to me. I wonder if there really is a place where all eventualities play out or if that place is our mind and we're already fourth dimensional beings.</p>
                <p>What if dreams are the homes we congregate in to discuss and deal with the paths we must follow? I sometimes attribute insomnia to the unwillingness to change state, but while it feels like we're making choices, our bodies are often guided by something beyond our control.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in fate, but who can ever be sure.</p>

                An exploration of acceptance, the need for shelter, and questions about what constitutes a true home and the American Dream.

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"When he looks into my eyes I feel accepted. I feel like the world's judgment has no place anymore and all that matters is him: what he thinks of me; how he wants me to change. As soon as his gaze passes I have nothing again and the adjustment to life's glare is uncomfortable; nothing but scrutiny and shame and hidden truths of inception."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Why is it that to be alone we have to define ourselves, while a shelter provides us all the comfort we need not to care? Maybe this is the American Dream, or the dream of the world, built around creating a place of escape and respite.</p>
                <p>What is a home? Or better still: why do we crave one?</p>
                <p>It is the core of humanity as we know it now: where demons go to hide and angels rise to receive. The mission seems simple enough in the beginning but reality will wear you down enough to accept only the things within your grasp. This is why children and raccoons end up running whatever crevasse you fall into; the bandits and natural born politicians.</p>
                <p>Maybe the true home is built on something foundationally different, but if it's not human, what is it? Can we collectively become a new species?</p>
                <p>I fully understand the need for escapism these days, but I worry it's just a severely clever method of control. Every theory and question folds in on yourself; looking inward to discover what? If we unify the answers it becomes religion and if we leave it to the collective, government is born. Where did we go so wrong?</p>
                <p>As long as it begins and ends with love, I suppose we'll be ok with it.</p>

                <p>Blank pages. Canvased to let the mind breathe and relax. Exhaustion.</p>

                <p>Darkness is everywhere, surrounding me like a ghost as I fish to find the light. Passiveness is the key to social interaction but it plagues the plight of the pillar; primping and priming, daydreaming of the story and its inevitable conclusion. Pondering at pomp and circumstance as it passes by.</p>
                <p>People are the key but work is the answer. Only isolation brings clarity of the mind.</p>
                <p>Leave trails like breadcrumbs in case you forget, since the path can be everything but clear. Whack the bush to thin the vines but leave the trunks alive because you have to; anything less and you'll lose your mind.</p>

                <p>Is this not the world we wanted?</p>
                <p>Something free, clear; no misguided signs of any sort. Everyone is open and receiving.</p>
                <p>But something is holding us back. Like a weight no one soul could bear. It is the feat of millions of soldiers; a system built from the corruption of closed doors.</p>
                <p>Fear them and they will triumph. Tackle them and they will stand. But there is no defeat greater than one of apathy.</p>
                <p>It is time, now, to change things. To begin to rewrite the history of the world. Our world.</p>
                <p>For what are we sold for if not what a machine could do better? Admit this human "flaw" as a feature and see what truly lies beneath.</p>
                <p>Humanity is inspiring, inventive, artistic - the times of money and sacrifice are behind us. Let our interests drive communication and fuel ideas. Let us build on what has come before and evolve.</p>
                <p>It is time.</p>
                <p>Energy is the source of our happiness, and the stress we feel from the every-day drains it. How long were we meant to suffer?</p>
                <p>No one is ever alone, we're just built to feel that way.</p>
                <p>A womb to a family, a family to a school, a school to a university; aren't you comfortable yet? Isn't the scary world ready for you, the young unbridled, coddled, molested and destructive youth?</p>
                <p>You must be fucking kidding.</p>
                <p>I paid to go to school; I work to pay back twice the amount. Do the math and we're screwed.</p>
                <p>Invest. Invest. Invest. In what? Do you find the dollars in the potholes and service monopolies and insurance and, wait, what's interest?</p>
                <p>The "Hunger Games," for all it's worth, gets one thing right: "If no one watches, then they don't have a game."</p>

                <p>Oh where, oh wild, did the stories of my childhood disappear to?</p>
                <p>I woke up the other morning in this solitude, alone and hidden from the things that crawl about outside, eating and hoping and dying in their little cars, a death-wish away from smashing five-piled-high outside the BestBuy and giving the radio another damn reason to talk on and over about nothing.</p>
                <p>It was beautiful outside, though I could only meet with thirty minutes at any one time because they thought I might do it again, in a bush with a twig maybe, I don't know.</p>
                <p>They called me a lost soul when I arrived; like so I guess they could assume complete control and responsibility over my life, just like that. I didn't argue, or even want to really, but I don't agree.</p>
                <p>A lost soul is someone twisted hard enough once to get lost, like an anchor caught on the ocean floor; life is the tide that comes to move you, but you can't move, and the harder life pulls, the deeper you sink, until finally you're back parallel with the ocean floor itself. That's not me: I'm not a lost soul. Life pulls, slightly tugs, maybe even a light breeze and I come uprooted.</p>
                <p><strong>You can't be lost if you have no anchor.</strong></p>
                <p>How did I get on this tangent? My mind is still mysterious, even to me. I allow it a certain freedom to ramble, which is both good and bad, but all the time interesting, so I don't attempt to stop it.</p>
                <p>Anyhow.</p>
                <p>"It's about making the effort."</p>
                <p>Oh, yeah, sure, that sums it up nicely; thank you Dr. Pedanski, for all the wisdom I paid you to have.</p>
                <p>I get tired of the normal things, you know, like walking up the stairs and checking the mail, but it would be a stretch to call me lazy. I like long walks on the beach; candlelit dinners… and you can call me Luc if we become friends.</p>
                <p>They told me it was best to keep a journal, of my thoughts, so I didn't lose my head. Reading back over the beginning, I don't think it's going to work. I haven't been up stairs in years.</p>
                <p>There were two funny things that ended up happening today. One: they told me about the disease. Two: they told me it had no cure.</p>
                <p>It was a good day.</p>
